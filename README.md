# Survival_Analysis
Survival analysis used for predictive maintenance for machines using Kaplan Meier curve

A report summarized the statistical modeling and analysis results for Preventive Maintenance Project. The purpose of that document was to understand exactly which factors produce failures and predict the moment when a machine will break in order to apply maintenance services or have breakup equipment ready. 
Data Provided have 90,000 instances of the maintenance work done across different machines in one year that work on 3 pressure points which captures breakdown instances from the installation of those machines.

Data was analyzed to find the expected duration of time until one or more events happen i.e failure in mechanical systems. R, Excel and Survival analysis has been used to analyze the data with the help of graphs and charts. In this repo you'll find documents and reports that help in predicting the Life expectancy and the probability of failure with respect to change in Pressure and Lifetime.
